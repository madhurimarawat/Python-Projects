<h2>Data Visualization Automobile Dataset</h2>
--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.
 <br>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of automobiles is done in python.<br>
--> CSV file contains the details of automobile-mileage,length,body-style among other attributes.<br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[60 rows X 6 columns].<br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>
--> Data visualization is done to analyze which body-style of car gives the most features.<br>
--> Patterns found in the analysis are listed.

<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<p>Short Description about all libraries used in Project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
  <li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
<li>Seaborn - It is an extension of Matplotlib library used to create more attractive and
informative statistical graphics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Visualization Nba Dataset</h2>
--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.
 <br>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of Nba players is done in python.<br>
--> CSV file contains the details of players-height,weight,team,position among other attributes.<br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[457 rows X 9 columns].<br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>
--> Data analysis is done to decide suitable data visulization technique. <br>
--> Finally Data Visualization is done to represent the analysis in an understandable way.<br>
