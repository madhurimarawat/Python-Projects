## About Python Programming

--> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br><br>
--> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br><br>
--> Python is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library.<br>

## Mode of Execution Used  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40">

--> Colaboratory, or ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research which allows anybody to write and execute python code in Jupyter notebook through the browser.<br><br>
--> Visit colab at:&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40"></a><br><br>
--> Create account using google account.<br><br>
--> Once account creation is done, we can directly start coding in colab.<br><br>
--> It supports Python and R.<br><br>
--> Files are directly saved in Google Drive.<br><br>
--> To install python library this command is used-
```
pip install library_name 
```

## **1. Data Visualization Automobile Dataset**

--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.<br><br>
--> Target was to see which automobile gives the most features and variations using data visualization.<br>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of automobiles is done in python.<br><br>
--> Data visualization is done to analyze which body-style of car gives the most features.<br><br>
--> Patterns found in the analysis are listed.

### Dataset Used

#### **Automobile Dataset**
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lauvshree/20ee07bfaa6d97364006fc2320092526">üîó<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" height =40 width=40 title="Automobile Dataset" alt="Automobile Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> This contains data about various automobile in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of automobile-mileage,length,body-style among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[60 rows X 6 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>

## **2. Data Visualization Nba Dataset**
--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.<br><br>
--> Target was to see the features and variations of this dataset and the best data visualization technique for this dataset.<br><br>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of new york taxi trip is done in python.<br><br>
--> Data analysis is done to decide suitable data visulization technique. <br><br>
--> Finally Data Visualization is done to represent the analysis in an understandable way.<br>

### Dataset Used
