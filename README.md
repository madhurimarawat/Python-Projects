<centre><h1>About Python Programming</h1></centre>
--> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br><br>
--> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br><br>
--> Python is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library.<br>

# Mode of Execution Used  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40">

--> Colaboratory, or ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research which allows anybody to write and execute python code in Jupyter notebook through the browser.<br><br>
--> Visit colab at:&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40"></a><br><br>
--> Create account using google account.<br><br>
--> Once account creation is done, we can directly start coding in colab.<br><br>
--> It supports Python and R.<br><br>
--> Files are directly saved in Google Drive.<br>

<h2>Data Visualization Automobile Dataset</h2>
--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.<br><br>
--> Target was to see which automobile gives the most features and variations using data visualization.<br>
<h2>Dataset Used</h2>
<h3>Automobile Dataset</h3>
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lauvshree/20ee07bfaa6d97364006fc2320092526">üîó<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" height =40 width=40 title="Automobile Dataset" alt="Automobile Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> This contains data about various automobile in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of automobile-mileage,length,body-style among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[60 rows X 6 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>

 <h2>Project</h2>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of automobiles is done in python.<br><br>
--> Data visualization is done to analyze which body-style of car gives the most features.<br><br>
--> Patterns found in the analysis are listed.

<h2>Libraries Used</h2>
<p>Short Description about all libraries used in Project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
  <li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
<li>Seaborn - It is an extension of Matplotlib library used to create more attractive and
informative statistical graphics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Visualization Nba Dataset</h2>
--> Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.<br><br>
--> Target was to see the features and variations of this dataset and the best data visualization technique for this dataset.<br>

 <h2>Dataset Used</h2>
<h3>NBA Players Dataset</h3>
--> Dataset is taken from: <a href="https://gist.github.com/ganeshbabuNN/80b55569fde8eb6a81518d4c8921c7a6" >üîó<img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/github/github-original-wordmark.svg" height =40 width=40 title="NBA Dataset" alt="NBA Dataset"> </a><br><br>
--> This contains data about various NBA Players in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.<br><br>
--> CSV file contains the details of players-height,weight,team,position among other attributes.<br><br>
--> It contains the following dimensions-[457 rows X 9 columns].<br><br>
--> The csv file is already preprocessed ,thus their is no need for data cleaning.<br>

<h2>Project</h2>
--> In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of Nba players is done in python.<br><br>
--> Data analysis is done to decide suitable data visulization technique. <br><br>
--> Finally Data Visualization is done to represent the analysis in an understandable way.<br>
